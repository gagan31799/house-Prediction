Things To Do


Explore the Housing dataset by creating the following plots:

Box plots between each categorical feature and the price.

Scatter plots between the numerical features and the price.

Convert categorical attributes into numerical attributes using feature encoding.

Build a linear regression model by selecting the most relevant features to predict the price of houses.

Evaluate the linear regression model by calculating the parameters such as coefficient of determination, MAE, MSE, RMSE, mean of residuals and by checking for homoscedasticity.
